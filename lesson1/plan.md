# Parts of a Computer Program

There are usually three parts to a program. What you give to the program as "input" or what you ask the computer program to do.

The computer "program" or `code` itself that is designed to achieve a result.

And the "output" or the result that comes out of the program.

- Input

  Input to a program is usually what you as a person could give to the program. In some cases the program may get its "input" from another program. 

  For a program that would like to convert distance from feet to meters the input could be a number that you give in feet. The Program itself does the conversion using feet-to-meters conversion on the given input. The Output would be simply printing out the result. 


- Program

  Comptuer Program is where all the code and the logic would stay to achieve a result. Most of the computer programs implement a certain set of steps or an `algorithm` to achieve a result. 

- Output

  Output is usually that comes out of a program and get displayed on the computer. It could be text or it could be things moving on the screen or images or movies.
