Coding after School
=======

A book supplement to the Coding after school program for middle school students. The book is divided into eight lessons with one lesson scheduled per week for eight weeks of school. Students are expected to spend at least an hour of instruction and computer time for each lesson.

This book primarily covers the basic programming concepts using [Python](http://www.python.org) programming language. Students try the examples and exercises either using [PencilCode](http://pencilcode.net) or [trinket](http://trinket.io).
